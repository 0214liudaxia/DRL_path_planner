# End of study project : Path planner for UAVs in warehouses using deep reinforcement learning

# Abstract 

The future of warehouse and distribution center management requires maximum flexibility,
Industry 4.0 is all about using technology to meet these needs. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) are also considered a key technology for smart warehouses. Among the challenges encountered
when using drones for warehouse automation is path planning. Several researches
have been made in order to solve this problem, the common goal of all the articles is to
achieve a solution with a minimum of cost, minimum of complexity, minimum of training
time and with a maximum of gain. Our work attempts to answer a main question which is :
How to use deep reinforcement learning to achieve a trajectory planner without the need
for a global map of the environment, and this by modeling the problem in the form of a
MDP model, then applying RL methods. However, to introduce robots to the market, mass
production at low cost is also a challenge. Therefore, in this work, we attempt to build a
pseudo-laser detection system based on direct depth matrix prediction from single camera
images while maintaining stable performance. The work was simulated using a 3D simulator.
The experimental results show on the one hand, the efficiency of the DDPG compared to the
PPO algorithm, and that the trained planner can be used directly in an unknown virtual
environment, on the other hand, the evaluations show that the approach Monocular camera
can replace laser use, although it takes longer.
Index Terms :UAV, path planner, deep reinforcement learning, markov decision process,
